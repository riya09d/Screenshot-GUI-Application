# Screenshot-GUI-Application
This Python script uses `pyautogui` and `tkinter` to create a GUI for taking screenshots. Clicking the "Take Screenshot" button captures the screen, saves the image with a timestamped filename in 'D:/Projects/screenshots/', and displays it. The interface is user-friendly and efficient.
